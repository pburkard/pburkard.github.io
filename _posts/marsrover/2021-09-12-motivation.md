I want to learn how to build a robot. What does it need, in order to actuate multiple motors? How should my robot look like?
My interest in astronomy and space exploration I decided to create a robot that (in a simple way) resembles a rover on planet Mars.

I decided to start the project with a Raspberry Pi 4, which acts as the "brain" of the mars rover. The robot will have wheels and a camera For the beginning thats all I know.
For major changes, I will devide the project into different versions.
