# Key features
- New chassis (wood)
- New driving system
- Improved wheels for indoors
- Dedicated battery pack for the Raspberry Pi (UPS)
- Environment sensors (temperature, humidity, pressure, light intensity, …)
- Distance sensor (time-of-flight)
- Servo controlled camera (180° rotatable)

## Chassis
The new wooden plate is now slightly larger for the potential use of a LIDAR scanner (in the video its already mounted, but currently not functional) and to fit in another battery. I cut out 4 rectangles to be able to mount the new servos securely with screws.

## New driving system
Version 2's driving system was not strong enough to be able to turn its wheels. Therefore I created a new system, which is again self designed and entirely 3d printed. It consists of ...
1. A new servo with more torque
2. An "arm" which is screwed onto the servo connection part (I used the circular one)
    Thanks to the 90° bent arm, the wheel itself is placed directly under the servo where the torque is coming from. This provides strength
3. Motor chassis, glued to part 1 -> could not be printed as a single part. The structure is not optimal for my FDM (fused deposition   modeling) printer
4. Motor to wheel connection (read "Broken wheel axle" for details)
5. Wheel, mounted via a hexagon shaped wheel adaptor (seen on commercial RC car wheels)

## Dedicated battery pack for the Raspberry Pi
Using one power source in version 2, the Raspberry Pi suffered from unstable power delivery at peak moments (-> running the motors and servos at once while driving). Unstable power supply could cause hardware problems and could even lead to the Raspberry Pi to turn off.
Thanks to the dedicated battery pack (uninterruptible power supply, UPS) the Raspberry Pi has independent and stable power supply.

## Environment sensors
To gather some data about the weather and surrounding, I added the [Environment Hat](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/Environment_Sensor_HAT) to the Mars Rover. It comes with the following features:
- Onboard TSL25911FN digital ambient light sensor, for measuring IR and visible light
- Onboard BME280 sensor, for measuring temperature, humidity, and air pressure
- Onboard ICM20948 motion sensor, accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer
- Onboard LTR390-UV-1 sensor, for measuring UV rays
- Onboard SGP40 sensor, for detecting ambient VOC

VOC stands for Volatile Organic Compounds and the sensor can determine the percentage of carbon-containing compounds in the atmosphere. A usecase of this sensor could be to notify you to open a window because insufficient air quality.
Sadly, the VOC sensor does not work anymore. After several successful tests, it suddenly stopped working.

I would definitely **not** recommend this product, because 1. the code library does not work directly (I had to try & error it until partially functional) and 2. the VOC sensor seems to be defect after only using it a handful of times. Would I do it again, I would buy seperate, specific sensors which I really need. 

**General Experience**: Buy a sensor in a higher price range. You do not only buy the hardware, its also the software and documentation! Fixing errors can take a long time.

## Distance sensor
To give the vehicle some data to work with, I mounted a VL53L0X "time of flight" distance sensor to the front of the rover. The module has a tiny, invisible laser and a matching sensor which detects the laser light again. The time difference (time of flight) outputs the distance to the closest object within its operation range.

# Difficulties
## I2C bus conflicts
With a total of 8 sensors and boards which are connected via the i2c bus, it can happen, that different devices conntect via the same address. This was not easy, since by far not all devices have the capability to change the address - especially for the cheap sensors which I use in this project. Here's one of the problems: the environment hat and the time-of-flight sensor interfered with each other by pointing to the same i2c addresses 0x29 (which is hexadecimal for 41). Adding another i2c bus ([Raspberry PI Multiple I2C Devices](https://www.instructables.com/Raspberry-PI-Multiple-I2c-Devices/)) solved this issue.

## Broken wheel axle
During testing, a motor-wheel connection broke. After some thinking, I decided to rethink the concept instead of repairing it because I noticed a lack of precision in the motor-wheel-connection already in version 2: The wheels did not turn accurately enough around their own axis because I soldered the two parts together. This turned out to be very hard to do (at least with my equipment), especially as precisely as I want it to be. And anyway, since the axle broke now, it was obviously not strong enough.

So I came up with 3 possible solutions:

**Solution 1** is partially 3d printed. The plastic and encapsulates both steel parts from the current solution and is glued together. The printed plastic is very precise and the whole part resulted much stronger.

**Solution 2** is entirely 3d printed and houses the screw which locks the part down on the motor. The main idea here is that I only need the just mentioned screw. This part would replace all metal parts in the wheel construction. The wheel will be screwed onto the hexagon shaped wheel adaptor.

**Solution 3** resulted after testing solution 2: The main flaw of solution 2 is that the plastic is not strong enough to tighten the screw enough to hold the wheel. Therefore I designed the cylinder to fit in a screw nut between the plastic. This way the part is easily strong enough to lock down the wheel axle to the motor. With the added screw nut, a new screw type is used.

The **third solution** is by far the best:
- It reduces the number of parts from 6 to 3: screw, screw nut and the 3d printable main-part. In any case, the screw and nut can be reused anytime and the main-part can be reprinted within minutes
- By far the physically strongest solution
- No glue need (one of my main goals is to be able to disassemble all parts of the rover. this keeps it flexible for changes and proofs of good engineering)
