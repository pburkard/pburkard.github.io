# Key features
- Better (and smaller) motors
- Self-printed wheels
- Servo motors to set each individual wheel to a specified angle
- Self-designed (and printed) servo-motor and driving-motor connection parts
- Writing code in Visual Studio Code over SSH on Raspberry Pi

# Description
A first try to create a movement and steering system from scratch. I had to learn [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) which is (among other things) a 3d modelling software. With some basic understanding, I am already able to create 3d models precisely like I want them to be and print them with the 3d printer.

The idea behind the quad-servo design is that the vehicle could just change its direction without actually moving like a regular car would do. I found this a really interesting point to start because also the latest Mars Rover "Perseverance" uses a similar approach (just with 6 wheels and turning a circle to change directions...). I mean, why not?

You could (much easier) achieve similar results with "[mecanum wheels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecanum_wheel)" but I am pretty sure they are not usable on Mars' sandy terrain...

# Negatives
- The strength from the servo to the wheel is very bad. Changing the position of the wheel does not work on my carpeted floor
- The wheels tend to have a sticky surface
- The baseplate is too small to fit instruments and sensors
