# Key features
- Raspberry Pi setup
- Power connection
- Connect motor-controller to system
- Wooden base plate 
- Design and print mounting systems for the parts to be removable again
- Basic motors with gearbox and directly attachable wheels

# Description
The first version was to "get the system running" and get to know some of the basic parts to create a remote-controlled vehicle.
The book "Roboter-Autos mit dem Raspberry Pi" taught me the basics of the Raspberry Pi and helped me to know what I need to be able to connect motors, sensors, etc. with each other.  
Very good book!
