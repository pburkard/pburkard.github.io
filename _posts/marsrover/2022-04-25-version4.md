# New features
- Dedicated battery pack for actuators (motors and servo-motors)
- Web interface for direct remote control ([Python Flask web application framework](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/))
- New servo control library ([Adafruit circuitpython servokit](https://docs.circuitpython.org/projects/servokit/en/latest))
- Python code working with multiple threads
- Run project in virtual environment ([Python venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html))
- Create tests ([pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/))

## Battery Pack
Thanks to a dedicated battery pack, the Mars Rover can now be controlled without using any wired connection. Makes driving around in the house much more fun.

### Mars Rover energy management
- Rechargeable Li-Polymer Battery Pack to power the motors and servos
- UPS (2x Lithium-Ion Batteries type 18650) to power the Raspberry Pi

## Web interface "Mars Rover Webcontrol"
I thought its cool to be able to control the Mars Rover directly. So I decided to get to know the Python Flask web application framework. Here's what the website looks like:

And here is a list of the key bindings to get a peek at the possibilities of the Mars Rover Webcontrol:

| Key | Control |
| ------- | --------------------------------- |
| ArrowUp / ArrowDown | Drive |
| Y | Wheel Position VERTICAL |
| X | Wheel Position HORIZONTAL |
| C | Wheel Position CIRCULAR |
| A / S / D / F / G --> D is center | Camera Position |
| Q | Update Sensor Data |
| W | Start/Stop Distance Measure |
| E | Stop Camera Stream |
| O | Shutdown Raspberry Pi |
| P | Reboot Raspberry Pi |
| T | Keep Distance To Object Mode |

## Adafruit servokit library
I completly changed the communication with the servos. I realized I used the deprecated library [Adafruit_Python_PCA9685](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_PCA9685). These are in use now:
- [Adafruit Circuitpython PCA9685](https://pypi.org/project/adafruit-circuitpython-pca9685/)
- [Adafruit Circuitpython Servokit](https://pypi.org/project/adafruit-circuitpython-servokit/)

PCA9685 is the servo driver board which I use to connect the servos to the Raspberry Pi (also the motors).
The new servo library "servokit" lets me control the servo by angle. Before I implemented the functionality myself - less fancy, less precise. To use this library would have been much easier from version 1 on but it did not work because of an I2C conflict, as mentioned in Version 3 > I2C bus conflicts. Much better now.

## Multiple threads
Running the code silmuntatiously on multiple threads allows the Mars Rover to do different tasks at the same time. For example, the "keep distance to object" functionality uses multiple threads:
1. Read distance measurement and decide if the vehicle is either: "too close", "too far" or "in range"
2. Control motors: either stop, spin forward or spin reverse depending on the parameters above

## Pytest framework
To learn about tests (unit testing) with Python, I started using the Pytest framework, which seems to be frequently used within the Python community. The unit tests allow me to quickly test certain parts (functionalities) of the rover. After critical changes on the vehicle's hardware or software, I am now able to quickly recheck important functionalities of the whole system.
- Motor (single)
- Servo (single, both used servo-types)
- Drive
- Wheelpositions
- Sensors

To be implemented:
- Take picture
- Drive -> for all wheelpositions, not only vertical
- Turn angle calibration

# LIDAR, unsuccessful tests
As already mounted on Version 3 on the rover, on version 4 I planned to implement data readings from the [LIDAR](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar) (Light Detection And Ranging) sensor. This turned out to be very hard. I managed to spin the sensor (360°) and get data, but you need to process this data somehow and I have not found a suitable library so far. Hopefully I find a way to use the LIDAR sensor on top of the Mars Rover.
