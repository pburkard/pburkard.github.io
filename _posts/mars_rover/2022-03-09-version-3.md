## Key points

- Improved servo-motor and driving-motor connection parts (designed and printed)
- Improved wheels
- New wooden plate as a fundamental structure
- Uninterruptible power supply for Raspberry Pi
- Environment sensors (temperature, humidity, pressure, light intensity, ...)
- Time-Of-Flight sensor for distance measurement on the front of the rover
- Movable camera system (180Â°)
- Web interface for remote control

## Additional information
### Comments
This version already feels like I've learned a lot from the first two versions. A new base plate, a different servo mounting system and a complete redesign of the movement and steering system.

The new wooden plate is now slightly larger for the potential use of a LIDAR scanner (in the video its already mounted, but currently not functional) and to fit a battery to power the motors.

In version 2, the Raspberry Pi suffered from unstable power delivery during usage of the motors. By adding a uninterruptible power supply, this problem was solved.

## Problems encountered
### I2c bus conflicts
With a total of 8 sensors and boards which are connected via the i2c bus, it can happen, that different devices conntect via the same address. This was not easy, since by far not all devices have the capability to change the address - especially for the cheap sensors which I use in this project. Here's one of the problems: the environment hat and the time-of-flight sensor interfered with each other by pointing to the same i2c addresses 0x29 (which is hexadecimal for 41). Adding another i2c bus ([Raspberry PI Multiple I2C Devices](https://www.instructables.com/Raspberry-PI-Multiple-I2c-Devices/)) solved this issue.

### Broken wheel axle
During testing, a motor-wheel connection broke. After some thinking, I decided to rethink the concept instead of repairing it because I noticed a lack of precision in the motor-wheel-connection already in version 2: The wheels did not turn accurately enough around their own axis because I soldered the two parts together. This turned out to be very hard to do (at least with my equipment), especially as precisely as I want it to be. And anyway, since the axle broke now, it was obviously not strong enough.

So I came up with 3 possible solutions:

***Solution 1*** is partially 3d printed. The plastic and encapsulates both steel parts from the current solution and is glued together. The printed plastic is very precise and the whole part resulted much stronger.

***Solution 2*** is entirely 3d printed and houses the screw which locks the part down on the motor. The main idea here is that I only need the just mentioned screw. This part would replace all metal parts in the wheel construction. The wheel will be screwed onto the hexagon shaped wheel adaptor.

***Solution 3*** resulted after testing solution 2: The main flaw of solution 2 is that the plastic is not strong enough to tighten the screw enough to hold the wheel. Therefore I designed the cylinder to fit in a screw nut between the plastic. This way the part is easily strong enough to lock down the wheel axle to the motor. With the added screw nut, a new screw type is used.

Solution 3 is by far the best solution:
- It reduces the number of parts from 6 to 3: screw, screw nut and the 3d printable part. In any case, the screw and nut can be reused anytime and the main part can be reprinted within minutes
- By far the strongest solution
- No glue need (one of my main goals is to be able to disassemble all parts of the rover. this keeps it flexible for changes and proofs of good engineering)
