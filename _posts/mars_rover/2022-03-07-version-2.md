# Key points
-   Better (and smaller) motors
-   Self-printed wheels
-   Servo motors to set each individual wheel to a specified angle
-   Self-designed (and printed) servo-motor and driving-motor connection parts
-   Writing code in Visual Studio Code over SSH on Raspberry Pi

# Description
A first try to create a movement and steering system from scratch. I had to learn "Blender" which is (among other things) a 3D Modelling software. With some basic understanding, I am already able to create 3D Models precisely like I want them to be and print them with the 3D printer.

The idea behind the quad-servo design is that the vehicle could just change its direction without actually moving like a regular car would do. I found this a really interesting point to start because also the latest Mars Rover "Perseverance" uses a similar approach (just with 6 wheels and turning a circle to change directions...). I mean, why not?

You could (much easier) achieve similar results with "[mecanum wheels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecanum_wheel)" but I am pretty sure they are not usable on Mars' sandy terrain...

# Negatives
-   The Strength from the servo to the wheel is very bad. Changing the position of the Wheel does not work on my carpeted floor
-   The Wheels tend to have a sticky surface
-   The baseplate is too small to fit instruments and sensors
